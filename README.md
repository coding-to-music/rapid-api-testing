# RapidAPI: have one place to access APIs and Microservices and build applications more efficiently and easily

Software developers can also share and collaborate on internal APIs

## About RapidAPI
We make it easier to find, connect to, and manage APIs
across multiple cloud environments - from the world’s
largest API Hub

## Driving Modern Software Development

It all began at a hackathon in 2015. RapidAPI was made by developers for developers so they could have one place to access APIs and Microservices and build applications more efficiently and easily. Today, RapidAPI is the world’s largest API Hub where almost 3 million developers can find, test, and connect to tens of thousands of APIs — all with a single account, single API key, and single SDK.

Software developers can also share and collaborate on internal APIs using RapidAPI for Teams, a common workspace to publish internal APIs and share public API subscriptions. In turn, organizations can use RapidAPI Enterprise to create a centralized hub environment to help developers reuse and connect to existing APIs faster while providing IT with enterprise-wide visibility and governance of API consumption.
